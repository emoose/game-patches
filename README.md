# Xenia Game Patches

This repository contains Game Patches available for the Xenia Emulator.

## Contributing

 - When submitting a game patch, make sure to create a Pull Request for a file to be added to the `patches` folder in the repository.

 - If the game you are submitting a patch for already has a .patch file, then create a Pull Request to edit that file instead of creating a new .patch file.

 - This new file must be named `[Title ID].patch` - For example, a patch file for Halo 3 must be called `4D5307E6.patch` (All uppercase)

 - File must contain empty line at end of file.

Example of the contents that should be included in the file:
